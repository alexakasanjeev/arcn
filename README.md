This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate that  provides **an architecture optimized for building solid cross-platform mobile applications** through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic to help you kickstart your new app

When starting new apps I found myself repeatedly setting up my project with same packages over and over again so I decided to automate this process

This boilerplate consists of various elements and best practices I learned while going though apps written by various talented developers in the React Native Community :zap:

While this mostly consists of how I organize my projects but can be easily extended to suit any workflow :smile:

If you're new to React Native feel free to checkout this repo I made where I keep all the learning resources I find: [Learn React Native](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/guides-and-articles/blob/master/Guides/Learn%20React%20Native.md)

If you face any issue then please checkout the Known Issues section below, but if the issue persists then feel free to open a issue so we can solve it together :smiley:

**Feel free to leave a :star: as motivation if this was useful to you :smile:**
